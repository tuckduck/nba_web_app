# NBA player web application
first React project for @tuckduck
## Functionality
Can search through NBA players with the search bar. The API has a search parameter which matches against player first OR last name.
When searches result in more players than can be displayed, scroll through pages with the buttons at the bottom of the page. 
Can switch between a Card and List view to view the players.
## Neat bits
Player cards are colored to reflect their team color
## Next Steps
Utilize more React Components. Main barrier to this is understanding how to create and inject components dynamically. ie. with the card
grid how to create new rows/columns and then insert a new card into them dynamically. Similar issue with using React listgroup, instead
had to work around using vanilla html. Also a better pattern for the dispatcher would probably be necessary as the app expands.
